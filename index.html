<h1>Basic HTML Display Features</h1>

<p>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation. </p>

<p>Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.</p>

<h2>Header Size</h2>

<p>To begin, we can change the header size and color of letters seen on the screen. The font size can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.</p>

<p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote. Now is the time for all good <b>people</b> to come to the aid of their country. </p>

<p>That was also an example of a nested command. </p>
